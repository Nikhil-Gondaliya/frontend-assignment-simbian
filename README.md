This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

Frontend Task
This project is built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive UI. My approach focused on simplicity and reusability—breaking the UI into modular components and ensuring smooth user interaction. The goal was to deliver a polished interface with minimal complexity and fast performance.

I used Framer Motion as the animation library to bring the UI to life with subtle transitions and motion effects that enhance the user experience without overwhelming it. With more time, I’d focus on improving accessibility, adding unit tests, and optimizing the animations for performance on lower-end devices. Additionally, introducing better error boundaries and a loading skeleton would make the app more robust.
